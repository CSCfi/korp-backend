Package korppluginlib

A class- and Blueprint-based proposal for a plugin framework for the Korp
backend

The classes are mostly for encapsulation: although plugin callbacks are
instance methods, the instances are singletons. Registering plugin callbacks
(for KorpCallbackPlugin subclasses) is handled in the metaclass, adapted from
or inspired by http://martyalchin.com/2008/jan/10/simple-plugin-framework/

WSGI endpoints are functions decorated with the route method of an instance of
korppluginlib.KorpEndpointPlugin.
